# Bike Trip Duration Prediction with BigQuery ML

This project aims to predict the duration of bike rentals using a regression model in BigQuery ML. We go through the process of creating a dataset, building and improving the model through 
feature engineering, and making predictions.

## Overview

1. **Visualizing Rental Duration by Station**
   - Use Looker Studio to check whether the duration of a rental varies by station.

2. **Candidate Feature Analysis**
   - Explore the impact of features like dayofweek or hourofday on rental duration.

3. **Bicycle Count Impact**
   - Investigate the impact of the number of bicycles on rental duration using Looker Studio. Determine whether it's a valuable feature.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Dataset

### 2. Create a Model

### 3. Improve Model through Feature Engineering

### 4. Make Model Using Transform Clause
   - Our best model involves several data transformations. Learn how to use the TRANSFORM clause in BigQuery to automate these transformations at the time of prediction.

### 5. Make Predictions

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the steps involved in predicting bike trip duration with BigQuery ML. Feel free to explore and adapt the process according to your specific requirements.
